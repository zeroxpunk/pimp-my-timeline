Tweets designed purely for engagement: rage bait, manufactured outrage, dunking on others for clout, obvious statements framed as hot takes, quote-tweets just to get mad, bragging about metrics/followers, "ratio" posts, and takes that exist only to provoke reactions rather than add insight. Hide performative drama over substance.
