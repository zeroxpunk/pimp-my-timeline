Tweets that read like AI-generated content: generic motivational takes, numbered lists of obvious advice ("10 things successful people do"), vague inspirational fluff with no real insight, overuse of phrases like "here's the thing", "let me be clear", "this is huge", or "unpopular opinion" followed by a popular opinion. Hide content that feels templated, overly polished, and says nothing specific.
